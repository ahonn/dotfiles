# Schema.org Types — Status & Recommendations (February 2026)

**Schema.org Version:** 29.4 (December 8, 2025)

## Format Preference
Always use **JSON-LD** (`<script type="application/ld+json">`).
Google's documentation explicitly recommends JSON-LD over Microdata and RDFa.

**AI Search Note:** Content with proper schema has ~2.5× higher chance of appearing in AI-generated answers (confirmed by Google and Microsoft, March 2025).

## Restricted — Only for specific site types

| Type | Restriction | Since |
|------|------------|-------|
| FAQPage | Government and healthcare authority sites ONLY | August 2023 |

> Google severely limited FAQ rich results in August 2023. Only authoritative sources (government, health organizations) receive FAQ rich results.
>
> **GEO nuance**: FAQPage schema still benefits AI/LLM citation visibility (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews), even without Google rich results.
> - **Existing FAQPage on commercial site**: Flag at Info priority, not Critical. Removal removes GEO citation upside.
> - **Adding new FAQPage**: Not recommended for Google benefit; acceptable if AI search visibility is a priority.
